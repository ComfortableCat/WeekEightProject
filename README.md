## Reflection
I think that I have completed all goals and I believe that the site runs fully functionally on the deployment.
I havent managed to include all the styling that I wanted which has left some areas confusing to the user.
I struggled with applying a recursive approach to the replys due to the client server components

I am happy and excited to see how my application of next.js continues although it doesnt make the best of sense to me right now and I can see how useful it is in certain situations
